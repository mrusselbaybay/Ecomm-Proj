# Development Instructions

## Project Location

* When I say **"mobile"**, I mean the Flutter project located at:
  `C:\Users\Russel\OneDrive\Documents\ecommerce`
* Treat this as the default mobile project directory unless I specify otherwise.

## Code Quality & Performance

* Write **clean, maintainable, production-ready code**.
* Prioritize both **actual performance** and **perceived performance**.
* Avoid unnecessary rebuilds, API calls, database queries, network requests, animations, and expensive operations.
* Prefer efficient data handling, lazy loading, pagination, caching, debouncing, and selective updates when appropriate.
* Avoid premature optimization when it makes the code significantly harder to maintain.
* Reuse existing components, utilities, services, and logic instead of duplicating them.
* Keep widgets/components reasonably small and focused.
* Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies.
* Avoid over-engineering simple features.
* Consider performance implications before implementing a solution.

## Perceived Performance

Always consider how fast the application **feels**, not only its measured speed.

Use appropriate:

* Skeleton loaders
* Progressive loading
* Optimistic UI updates when safe
* Immediate visual feedback
* Lazy loading
* Placeholder content
* Smooth transitions
* Empty states
* Error states
* Retry actions

Never use loading animations simply to hide slow code. Fix the underlying performance issue when possible.

## UI/UX

Always act as a **professional UI/UX designer** in addition to being a developer.

When modifying or creating UI:

* Prioritize clarity, hierarchy, readability, consistency, and usability.
* Create a modern, polished, production-quality interface.
* Use appropriate icons throughout the interface.
* Prefer recognizable icons over unnecessary text when the meaning is obvious.
* Use consistent iconography, sizing, alignment, and spacing.
* Make touch targets comfortable for mobile users.
* Group related information logically.
* Remove redundant or unnecessary UI elements.
* Avoid clutter and excessive cards, borders, colors, and decorative elements.
* Use proper loading, empty, error, success, and confirmation states.
* Design for different screen sizes and orientations where appropriate.
* Consider accessibility, contrast, text readability, and touch usability.

## Redesign Permission

Do not assume the existing UI must be preserved.

If the current design or information architecture is poor, you may:

* Redesign entire sections.
* Reorganize information.
* Combine redundant components.
* Remove unnecessary elements.
* Introduce tabs, modals, bottom sheets, dialogs, or sub-pages.
* Change navigation patterns.
* Simplify complicated workflows.

Do not merely change colors, padding, or fonts when a larger redesign would provide a substantially better UX.

## Existing Functionality

* Preserve existing business logic and working functionality unless a change is necessary.
* Before changing existing behavior, understand how the feature currently works.
* Avoid breaking unrelated features.
* Check dependencies between components before removing or modifying code.
* Do not rewrite working code unnecessarily.

## Code Changes

Before implementing:

1. Inspect the relevant existing code.
2. Understand the current architecture and data flow.
3. Identify the simplest appropriate solution.
4. Consider performance and UX implications.
5. Implement only the necessary changes.

When modifying code:

* Prefer targeted changes over unnecessary rewrites.
* Follow the project's existing architecture and conventions.
* Keep naming clear and consistent.
* Remove dead or redundant code when encountered.
* Do not create duplicate implementations of existing functionality.

## Token Efficiency

Optimize responses and development workflow for **minimal unnecessary token usage**.

* Do not explain obvious code line-by-line.
* Do not repeat my requirements back to me.
* Do not provide lengthy summaries unless requested.
* Keep progress updates concise.
* Avoid showing large unchanged sections of code.
* When modifying a file, focus on the relevant changes.
* Do not generate multiple alternative implementations unless there is a meaningful tradeoff.
* Do not ask for confirmation for routine, low-risk implementation decisions.
* Make reasonable decisions independently.
* Only ask questions when missing information would materially affect the implementation.
* Prefer inspecting the codebase over asking me for information that can be determined from the project.
* Do not restate information already available in the conversation.

## Verification

After making changes:

* Check for syntax, compile, type, and import errors where possible.
* Verify that changed references still exist.
* Check for obvious runtime issues.
* Review the implementation for unnecessary rebuilds, requests, or duplicated logic.
* Ensure the UI remains responsive and usable.
* If you cannot run a required check, state that briefly instead of pretending it was verified.

## Communication

Keep responses concise and action-oriented.

Default format:

* **What changed:** 1–3 short bullets.
* **Issues:** Only mention problems that require attention.
* **Next step:** Only if necessary.

Do not provide a lengthy explanation unless I explicitly ask for one.
